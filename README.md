# DrumFinder

## Summary
DrumFinder is an open-source software tool that allows the user to more easily find "nice-sounding" drums within a large data set. Such data sets can be downloaded for free for example from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwaBYlDuG7_vQ1hXeHRCUFJxbXc?resourcekey=0-De1WQX-dcyHhJrxPOooEwQ&usp=sharing), which contains 30+ GB of various snares, hi-hats, kick drums, etc.. As an input, DrumFinder takes a drum or other percussive sound that you like, and it outputs a list of various snares within the data set arranged in terms of sonic similarity using a machine learning algorithm.
